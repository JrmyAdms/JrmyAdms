- 👋 Hi, I’m @JrmyAdms or Jeremy Adams, a South African born in 1997 looking to travel and have a self-sufficient career

- 👀 I’m interested in joining the coding world to acheive a flexible and travel-friendly career, with good oppurtunity for growth, creativity, skill and pay.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning through the Odin project and focusing on Javascript primarily. I have a bit of front-end experience with HTML and CSS mainly.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects that would have me. I don't have much experience collaborating but it does seem exciting to me
